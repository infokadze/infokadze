 <h1 align="center"> Hi </h1> 

All in all, created 15+ iOS apps for the third-party client, most of which were published on AppStore.

- Services and tools:
 Xcode, Figma, GitHub, Jira Confluence, Trello, Google Workspace, Quicktype.io, Terminal(zsh), Postman, RapidAPI, jsonformatter.org, nsdateformatter.com.

- I develop iOS apps using FLUX / MVVM + Coordinator + DI,  follow GitHub Flow for version control and use following APIs:
UIKit, Combine, CombineCocoa, Foundation, MongoDB (RealmSwift, Atlas Flexible Sync), Firebase, XCTest, Localization, Local Notifications, Encryption, AVFoundation, PencilKit, HealthKit, ReplayKit, Keychain. 

- I develop app's UI using XIBs in combination with programmatic approach.
  
- REST APIs I used -> odds-api, news-api, newsdata.io, api-sports.io, Goalserve, TheSportsDB.

- I used to work with such pods/packages as: Lottie, Loaf, SwiftLint, SwiftGen, SDWebImage, Kingfisher, SwiftyBeaver, OpenAISwift, YPImagePicker, iCarousel, SwiftFortuneWheel, FSCalendar, MBProgressHUD, Charts, ChartProgressBar, DropDown, SideMenu, AdvancedPageControl, youtube_ios_player_helper, UnityAds, Google AdMob.

P.S.: I have minor sound design knowledge using various DAWs, VSTs, etc., so I do enjoy creating sound assets on my own when possible.
My apps' screenshots could be seen upon request.
