 <h1 align="center"> Hi there ðŸ“± </h1> 

My name is Igor and at the moment, I have 10+ completed apps for the third-party client, most of which were published on AppStore.

- My go-to services and tools:
 Xcode, Figma, GitHub, Jira Confluence, Google Workspace, Quicktype.io, jsonformatter.org, nsdateformatter.com, Terminal(zsh), Postman, RapidAPI, MacGPT.

- I develop iOS apps using MVVM + Coordinator + DI pattern along with following APIs: UIKit, Combine, CombineCocoa, Foundation, PencilKit, HealthKit, ReplayKit, Keychain, MongoDB (RealmSwift, Atlas Flexible Sync), Firebase, XCTest, Localization, Local Notifications, Encryption.
- I develop app's UI using XIB in combination with Programmatic approach;
- Network REST APIs I used -> odds-api, news-api, newsdata.io, api-sports.io, Goalserve, TheSportsDB;

- I used to work with such CocoaPods as: Lottie, Loaf, SwiftLint, SwiftGen, SDWebImage, Kingfisher, YPImagePicker, iCarousel, SwiftFortuneWheel, FSCalendar, MBProgressHUD, Charts, ChartProgressBar, DropDown, SideMenu, AdvancedPageControl, youtube_ios_player_helper, UnityAds, Google AdMob, etc;

P.S.: I have minor sound design knowledge using various DAWs, VSTs, etc., so I do enjoy creating sound assets on my own when possible.
My apps' screenshots could be seen upon request.
