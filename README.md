# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Igor and at the moment, I have 10+ completed apps for the third-party client, most of which were published on AppStore.
All in all:

- I develop using UIKit most of the times along with MVC+C or MVP+C using UserDefaults, Realm, Notification Center, Autolayout, CoreAnimation, TableViews, CollectionViews, JSON parsing,  Storyboard / Programmatic / NIBs mixed layout approach;

- CocoaPods / Homebrew -> I feel comfortable with such as: FSCalendar, SDWebImage, YPImagePicker, SQLite.swift, iCarousel, SwiftFortuneWheel, Lottie, RealmSwift, SwiftLint, Eureka, youtube_ios_player_helper, UnityAds, Google AdMob, etc;

- APIs ->  I have used odds-api, news-api, api-sports.io (do not recommend) and TheSportsDB along with Postman in my projects;

- I have minor sound design knowledge using various DAWs, VSTs, etc., so I do enjoy creating sound assets on my own when possible;

- Send me an email if you are just curious about my work at infokadze@gmail.com, check my CV at https://github.com/infokadze/CV or message me directly via LinkedIn -> https://www.linkedin.com/in/igor-prokopenko-4b5a9a225/.

- Apps' Code is available upon request.

## Description of some of my finished apps could be found below:

**EggCoockingApp.**
* Egg Cooking Timer App allows user to set the custom time modes for egg boiling preferences (light, middle, hard) with some cool animations and notifications  when the cooking is over. Timer does continue to work even if the app might go to background (phone call or if some other system interruptions might occur). Done programmatically. My first commercial app.

Done with UIKit, no design patterns have been followed.

**Captain Cooks.**
* Captain Cooks is an adventure multi-purpose game, where you can play memorize-like game as a bonus game as well as play original slots casino-like game with various animated levels, sounds and great UX. Background music has been done by me using Ableton and various vsti's.

Done with UIKit, no design patterns have been followed.

**1Win.**
* The app, which allows user to spare some free time playing some interactive games, such as: Lucky Roulette, Slots and Fortune Wheel. Slots includes great UI, various visual backgrounds and possibility to use auto-spin functionality and oppotunity to place bets depending on your win progress. Roulette has a classic look, custom animation and win/lose popups. The game allows user to place bets with the same fashion as it is used in Slots game. Fortune Wheel has a catchy design and allows user to earn additional coins with opportunity to watch an advertisment and get a free spin with even greater chance of win.

Created using UIKit with Model - View - Presenter + Coordinator design approach.

**Baseball Stats.**
* Baseball Stats allows user to monitor matches from most of the baseball leagues worldwide with division on past/live/upcoming games using api-sports.io as a source of data. User has opportunity to predict the score and save it by applying selection on match details screen.

Created using UIKit with MVC-like-ish + Coordinator design approach.
